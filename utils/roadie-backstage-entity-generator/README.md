# Roadie Backstage entity generator

- It generates every non archived github repo as a type: service and lifecycle: experimental
- They are generated into a `templates` -> `repository name` - `catalog-info.yaml` structure to make sure it is easy to open a pull request for every repo to put the file into the repo.
